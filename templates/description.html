<p>The AVeriTeC challenge aims to evaluate the ability of systems to verify real-world claims with evidence from the Web.</p>

<p>The AVeriTeC shared task is part of the 7th FEVER Workshop, co-located with <a href="https://2024.emnlp.org/">EMNLP2024</a> and will be held in Miami, Florida, United States in November 2024.</p>

<p>The systems in the shared task have to perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Given a claim and its metadata, the systems must retrieve evidence that supports and/or refutes the claim, either from the Web or from the document collection provided.</li>
<li> Using this evidence, label the claim as Supported, Refuted given the evidence, Not Enough Info (if there isn't sufficient evidence to either support or refute it) or Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking (if the claim has both supporting and refuting evidence).</li>
<ul>
